## ComStorm

### Background

ComStorm is a mobile app for making comics, built using React Native. This app is intended to improve the poor quality of content in newspaper comics after the retirement of Bill Watterson. With how easy it is to get carpal tunnel syndrome, this app might end up saving lives :).

### Functionality and MVP

Users will be able to

- [ ] click templates and drag to reposition in the drawing box
- [ ] add text to speech and thought bubbles
- [ ] save the created comic strip to their phone's gallery

### Technologies and Technical Challenges

This app will be built using React Native and vanilla JavaScript. React Native will also be used for the styling.

The technical challenges of this project will be:

- Determining the implementation of drag and drop for figures and bubbles on to the canvas.
- Determining the implementation of slider listing figures and bubbles.
- Identifying ways to incorporate text input inside speech and thought bubbles.
- Storing a user's creations in internal storage.
